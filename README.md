processor_modelling
===================


This GitHub "Processor Modeling" Related Infra has been formed to list the following:

   1\ Modeling of Registers, Cache(s), ALU, Fetch/Decode/Execute Units

   2\ Try to generalize the models so that all processors could be made to fit into this

   3\ Create a spreadsheet listing all these features capturing all the design details

   4\ Python modules based parser generating the about processor model from the design details captured in the spread sheet

   5\ Automated Build Environment (Makefile)
